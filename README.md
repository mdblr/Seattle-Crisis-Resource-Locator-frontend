# Seattle Crisis Resource Locator (frontend)

Being homeless is no joke. Whether you find yourself unexpectedly without a home or are chronically homeless, it is not easy finding the information you need. In many cases, getting access to a computer or internet raises the level of difficulty additionally. Inspired by the digital signage (see below) along Rapid Ride metro bus routes, the Seattle Crisis Resource Locator could be run on any digital signage platform in major public areas. Consolidating data on available material, health, and human resources within a one mile radius, the information becomes readily available to someone.
